		<p>I am a self starting, curious, detail-oriented individual from the Bronx, New York with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Hunter College.</p>
		<p>Fascinated with all things VR/AR/MR and video game development/design, I tinker away at projects on Unity and other game engines in order to make quality games and experiences.</p>
		<p>I have the following game design influences: The Legend of Zelda, Pokemon, Overwatch, Warcraft, Bioshock, Metroid Prime, as well as rogue-like indie games, such as Dungeon Souls and Dead Cells. These are just some influences, as I have a long history of playing video games.</p>
		<p>I enjoy programming and currently teach programming and game design at Manhattan Youth, an afterschool program. My favorite code editor is Sublime Text, and can be often found using C++, C#, or python across my projects.</p>
		<p>When not programming, I can be found playing a video game, reading a book or comic, catching up on world news, or looking for my next project.</p>
		<p>I am also interested in the intersections of social justice and technology, as well as machine learning and software engineering.</p>
